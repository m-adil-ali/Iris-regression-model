# Linear Regression model on Iris dataset
## Step-by-step process.
1. Import Libraries
2. Load dataset
3. Check null values
4. Define X and y to visualize outliers
5. Plotting different plots
6. Converting categorical data into numerical
7. calling model to predict after train-test-split
8. converting predicted numerical data into categorical
9. Finding accuracy based on scores
10. Finding accuracy based on metrics
11. A/c to the metrics and score answers the model is predicting 90% accuracy.
