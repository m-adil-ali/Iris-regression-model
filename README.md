# Linear Regression model on Iris dataset
## Step-by-step process.
1. Import Libraries
2. Load dataset
3.   EDA Analysis:
  1. Check null values
  2. Visualize data to remove outliers
  3. Plotting different plots to normalize data
  4. Converting categorical data into numerical
4. Model building steps:
  1. Define X and y to use train-test-split
  2. Calling model to predict
  3. Converting predicted numerical data into categorical
  4. Finding accuracy based on scores
  5. Finding accuracy based on metrics
5. A/c to the metrics and score answers the model is predicting with 90% accuracy.
